Motion Tracker Plus
-----

###Brief
Based on MotionTracker class by [Justin Windle](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk), extended to return multiple points.
###Features
####Freeze background
	motionTracker.freezeBackground = true/false;
####Return multiple points or unique movement tracker
	motionTracker.returnBlobs = true/false;
####Configurable interval for detecion
	motionTracker.interval = NN;//miliseconds
####Scalable tracking source for better performance (I think)
	motionTracker.scaleIndex = 0.5;//input will be scaled prior to processing the image
###Issues
Flashplayer sacrifices camera fps when dealing with iterations. When camera fps drops, the whole detection
process falls to a laggy response. Hopefully someone will find a cure for this :)

In case I've done any wrong in publishing this work, please let me know. All I've used I've found in SOURCE
avalability on some of the sites mentioned.
Sorry if my code is somewhat messy, I try to make it clean so others can read it, but sometimes
you'll find yourself reading some derranged thoughts I have as I code.
